This program draws the Github's contribution activity calendar randomly and save it to a PNG file.

### How to run
```
git clone https://github.com/mostafa-asg/git-cont-act
cd git-cont-act
go build
./git-cont-act
```
By default it creates `output.png` file in the current directory but you can pass the output's file name in the programm argument.
